This was a Brythonic area, speaking a form of primitive Welsh, until perhaps the 9th century as a relict of the kingdom of Elmet. The spellings Ludingdene, Luddington and Luddyngden are found. The community is first mentioned in 1284. In 1375, a corn mill was moved from Warley Town to exploit the Luddenden Brook. With the introduction of water power, many textile mills were established in the district. The cobbled packhorse trail which runs through the village, down Old Lane from Midgley, crossing the river and on up Halifax Lane to Warley, was once the equivalent of the modern day M62, providing a major goods route through the Pennines when the main mode of transport was packhorses. The area including fellow nearby town of Bramham was used for filming external scenes in the 1980s ITV Yorkshire Television situation comedy series In Loving Memory, starring Dame Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny.

The station was opened in 1883 as Easington, the name changing in 1904 to Grinkle after the local house and seat of the Baronets Palmer, Grinkle Park.

The king was so happy to find his ring he married the young maiden. The name Pike-ring got changed over the years to Pickering. The tourist venues of Pickering Parish Church, with its medieval wall paintings, Pickering Castle, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Beck Isle Museum have made Pickering popular with visitors. Nearby places include Malton, Norton and Scarborough. &lt;em&gt;Source Wikipedia&lt;/em&gt;'\n",

'The settlement is part of the Luddendenfoot ward of the Metropolitan borough of Calderdale, part of the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire The name means Ludd valley, or valley of the loud stream and refers to the Luddenden Brook. An alternative meaning refers to the Celtic water god Lud, who gave his name to many water-related features. This was a Brythonic area, speaking a form of primitive Welsh, until perhaps the 9th century as a relict of the kingdom of Elmet. The spellings Ludingdene, Luddington and Luddyngden are found. The community is first mentioned in 1284. In 1375, a corn mill was moved from Warley Town to exploit the Luddenden Brook. With the introduction of water power, many textile mills were established in the district. The cobbled packhorse trail which runs through the village, down Old Lane from Midgley, crossing the river and on up Halifax Lane to Warley, was once the equivalent of the modern day M62, providing a major goods route through the Pennines when the main mode of transport was packhorses. The area including fellow nearby town of Bramham was used for filming external scenes in the 1980s ITV Yorkshire Television situation comedy series In Loving Memory, starring Dame Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny. The village has a lovely church \"St Mary\\'s\" and a very old pub \"The Lord Nelson\" where Branwell Bronte once drank and is asserted to have established the first public library in one of the upstairs rooms.

The side chapel and several of the furnishings are by the firm of 'Mousey' Thompson of Kilburn. The village public house, the Tiger Inn, was previously a building of the same name at the opposite end of the village. The village had a railway station on the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway. The station was opened in 1883 as Easington, the name changing in 1904 to Grinkle after the local house and seat of the Baronets Palmer, Grinkle Park. The renaming was to avoid confusion with the station at the larger Easington, County Durham, also on the North Eastern Railway's network.

       "[36] \"Ruswarp is a village within the Scarborough borough of North Yorkshire, England. It lies around 1.8 miles (2.9 km) from Whitby, at the junction of the B1410 and B1416 roads, on the River Esk and the Esk Valley Line, with trains stopping at Ruswarp railway station. Originally called Risewarp (c.1146) meaning 'silted land overgrown with brushwood'. The heritage steam train services from Pickering to Whitby pass through Ruswarp, however they do not stop at the Ruswarp platform. Bus services also connect the town to the surrounding area. The village is served by local shops, including A.P. Jackson Butcher, an award winning butchers specialising in sausages, local meats and baked goods from the Stonehouse Bakery. There is a pub, the Bridge Inn and a church, the Ruswarp Church of St. Bartholomew. Primary education is catered for by a local Church of England primary school . Crossing the River Esk downstream is an impressive viaduct, 120 feet high, which was built (using 5,250,000 bricks) to carry the Scarborough-to-Whitby railway line, which was closed in 1965. The viaduct is now owned by Sustrans and carries \\\"The Cinder Track\\\" (a walk/cycleway along the former Whitby-to-Scarborough railway line). There is a pleasant and physically undemanding walk between Ruswarp and Whitby (approximately 1½ miles) mostly along a stone pannierway, known as Monks Trod. The walk is signposted from the main street in Ruswarp. Follow the Esk Valley Walk signs to Whitby. The village also boasts one of the area's most popular tourist attractions, Esk Leisure, which consists of Mini Monsterz Indoor Play with pottery painting and laser tag. Also at Esk Leisure is Outdoor Laser Combat and a Farm Park which once was a 9-hole pitch &amp; Put which closed in October 2009. Opposite Esk Leisure you can find Ruswarp Pleasure Boats. Established in 1874 customers can rent rowing boats or canoes to explore the sheltered waters that offer a unique opportunity to see the wildlife on this, the only migratory Salmon river in Yorkshire. There is also a popular miniature steam railway for children and adults alike. Ruswarp Village Hall caters for lots of community events and classes.

       "[44] \"Pickering is an ancient market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, on the border of the North York Moors National Park. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it sits at the foot of the moors, overlooking the Vale of Pickering to the south. According to legend the town was founded by King Peredurus around 270BC; however, the town as it exists today is of medieval origin. The legend states the town was named by King Peredurus; he lost his ring and accused a young maiden of stealing it, but later that day the ring was found in a pike caught that day in the River Costa for his dinner. The king was so happy to find his ring he married the young maiden. The name Pike-ring got changed over the years to Pickering. The tourist venues of Pickering Parish Church, with its medieval wall paintings, Pickering Castle, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Beck Isle Museum have made Pickering popular with visitors.

       "[51] \"Ingleton is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. The village is 19 miles (30 km) from Kendal and 17 miles (28 km) from Lancaster on the western side of the Pennines. It is 9.3 miles (15 km) from Settle. The River Doe and the River Twiss meet to form the source of the River Greta, a tributary of the River Lune. The village is on the A65 road and at the head of the A687. The B6255 takes the south bank of the River Doe to Ribblehead and Hawes. All that remains of the railway in the village is the landmark Ingleton Viaduct.

       "[59] \"The settlement is part of the Luddendenfoot ward of the Metropolitan borough of Calderdale, part of the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire The name means Ludd valley, or valley of the loud stream and refers to the Luddenden Brook. An alternative meaning refers to the Celtic water god Lud, who gave his name to many water-related features. This was a Brythonic area, speaking a form of primitive Welsh, until perhaps the 9th century as a relict of the kingdom of Elmet. The spellings Ludingdene, Luddington and Luddyngden are found. The community is first mentioned in 1284. In 1375, a corn mill was moved from Warley Town to exploit the Luddenden Brook. With the introduction of water power, many textile mills were established in the district. The cobbled packhorse trail which runs through the village, down Old Lane from Midgley, crossing the river and on up Halifax Lane to Warley, was once the equivalent of the modern day M62, providing a major goods route through the Pennines when the main mode of transport was packhorses. The area including fellow nearby town of Bramham was used for filming external scenes in the 1980s ITV Yorkshire Television situation comedy series In Loving Memory, starring Dame Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny. The village has a lovely church \\\"St Mary's\\\" and a very old pub \\\"The Lord Nelson\\\" where Branwell Bronte once drank and is asserted to have established the first public library in one of the upstairs rooms. In recent years the village has reestablished the position of Village Mayor, the role is primarily about raising funds for local charitable causes and investment in the village.<br /><br /><em>Source: Wikipedia</em>\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "[60] \"Easington is a village in the unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland and the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the village is situated on the A174 road 1 mile (1.6 km) east from Loftus, and inside the North York Moors National Park. Easington's church, dedicated to All Saints', is Grade II listed. The church was built in 1888–89 by C. Hodgson Fowler in Decorated style, largely with bequests from the Palmer family of Grinkle Park, and incorporated fragments and remains of the previous church. The side chapel and several of the furnishings are by the firm of 'Mousey' Thompson of Kilburn. The village public house, the Tiger Inn, was previously a building of the same name at the opposite end of the village. The village had a railway station on the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway. The station was opened in 1883 as Easington, the name changing in 1904 to Grinkle after the local house and seat of the Baronets Palmer, Grinkle Park. The renaming was to avoid confusion with the station at the larger Easington, County Durham, also on the North Eastern Railway's network. The station closed on the eve of the Second World War and never re-opened. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em>\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

This was a Brythonic area, speaking a form of primitive Welsh, until perhaps the 9th century as a relict of the kingdom of Elmet. The spellings Ludingdene, Luddington and Luddyngden are found. The community is first mentioned in 1284. In 1375, a corn mill was moved from Warley Town to exploit the Luddenden Brook. With the introduction of water power, many textile mills were established in the district. The cobbled packhorse trail which runs through the village, down Old Lane from Midgley, crossing the river and on up Halifax Lane to Warley, was once the equivalent of the modern day M62, providing a major goods route through the Pennines when the main mode of transport was packhorses. The area including fellow nearby town of Bramham was used for filming external scenes in the 1980s ITV Yorkshire Television situation comedy series In Loving Memory, starring Dame Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny.

An alternative meaning refers to the Celtic water god Lud, who gave his name to many water-related features. This was a Brythonic area, speaking a form of primitive Welsh, until perhaps the 9th century as a relict of the kingdom of Elmet. The spellings Ludingdene, Luddington and Luddyngden are found. The community is first mentioned in 1284. In 1375, a corn mill was moved from Warley Town to exploit the Luddenden Brook. With the introduction of water power, many textile mills were established in the district. The cobbled packhorse trail which runs through the village, down Old Lane from Midgley, crossing the river and on up Halifax Lane to Warley, was once the equivalent of the modern day M62, providing a major goods route through the Pennines when the main mode of transport was packhorses.

       "[36] \"Ruswarp is a village within the Scarborough borough of North Yorkshire, England. It lies around 1.8 miles (2.9 km) from Whitby, at the junction of the B1410 and B1416 roads, on the River Esk and the Esk Valley Line, with trains stopping at Ruswarp railway station. Originally called Risewarp (c.1146) meaning 'silted land overgrown with brushwood'. The heritage steam train services from Pickering to Whitby pass through Ruswarp, however they do not stop at the Ruswarp platform. Bus services also connect the town to the surrounding area. The village is served by local shops, including A.P. Jackson Butcher, an award winning butchers specialising in sausages, local meats and baked goods from the Stonehouse Bakery. There is a pub, the Bridge Inn and a church, the Ruswarp Church of St. Bartholomew. Primary education is catered for by a local Church of England primary school . Crossing the River Esk downstream is an impressive viaduct, 120 feet high, which was built (using 5,250,000 bricks) to carry the Scarborough-to-Whitby railway line, which was closed in 1965. The viaduct is now owned by Sustrans and carries \\\"The Cinder Track\\\" (a walk/cycleway along the former Whitby-to-Scarborough railway line). There is a pleasant and physically undemanding walk between Ruswarp and Whitby (approximately 1½ miles) mostly along a stone pannierway, known as Monks Trod. The walk is signposted from the main street in Ruswarp. Follow the Esk Valley Walk signs to Whitby. The village also boasts one of the area's most popular tourist attractions, Esk Leisure, which consists of Mini Monsterz Indoor Play with pottery painting and laser tag. Also at Esk Leisure is Outdoor Laser Combat and a Farm Park which once was a 9-hole pitch &amp; Put which closed in October 2009. Opposite Esk Leisure you can find Ruswarp Pleasure Boats. Established in 1874 customers can rent rowing boats or canoes to explore the sheltered waters that offer a unique opportunity to see the wildlife on this, the only migratory Salmon river in Yorkshire. There is also a popular miniature steam railway for children and adults alike. Ruswarp Village Hall caters for lots of community events and classes.

       "[44] \"Pickering is an ancient market town and civil parish in the Ryedale district of North Yorkshire, England, on the border of the North York Moors National Park. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, it sits at the foot of the moors, overlooking the Vale of Pickering to the south. According to legend the town was founded by King Peredurus around 270BC; however, the town as it exists today is of medieval origin. The legend states the town was named by King Peredurus; he lost his ring and accused a young maiden of stealing it, but later that day the ring was found in a pike caught that day in the River Costa for his dinner. The king was so happy to find his ring he married the young maiden. The name Pike-ring got changed over the years to Pickering. The tourist venues of Pickering Parish Church, with its medieval wall paintings, Pickering Castle, the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and Beck Isle Museum have made Pickering popular with visitors.

       "[51] \"Ingleton is a village and civil parish in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. The village is 19 miles (30 km) from Kendal and 17 miles (28 km) from Lancaster on the western side of the Pennines. It is 9.3 miles (15 km) from Settle. The River Doe and the River Twiss meet to form the source of the River Greta, a tributary of the River Lune. The village is on the A65 road and at the head of the A687. The B6255 takes the south bank of the River Doe to Ribblehead and Hawes. All that remains of the railway in the village is the landmark Ingleton Viaduct.

       "[59] \"The settlement is part of the Luddendenfoot ward of the Metropolitan borough of Calderdale, part of the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire The name means Ludd valley, or valley of the loud stream and refers to the Luddenden Brook. An alternative meaning refers to the Celtic water god Lud, who gave his name to many water-related features. This was a Brythonic area, speaking a form of primitive Welsh, until perhaps the 9th century as a relict of the kingdom of Elmet. The spellings Ludingdene, Luddington and Luddyngden are found. The community is first mentioned in 1284. In 1375, a corn mill was moved from Warley Town to exploit the Luddenden Brook. With the introduction of water power, many textile mills were established in the district. The cobbled packhorse trail which runs through the village, down Old Lane from Midgley, crossing the river and on up Halifax Lane to Warley, was once the equivalent of the modern day M62, providing a major goods route through the Pennines when the main mode of transport was packhorses. The area including fellow nearby town of Bramham was used for filming external scenes in the 1980s ITV Yorkshire Television situation comedy series In Loving Memory, starring Dame Thora Hird and Christopher Beeny. The village has a lovely church \\\"St Mary's\\\" and a very old pub \\\"The Lord Nelson\\\" where Branwell Bronte once drank and is asserted to have established the first public library in one of the upstairs rooms. In recent years the village has reestablished the position of Village Mayor, the role is primarily about raising funds for local charitable causes and investment in the village.<br /><br /><em>Source: Wikipedia</em>\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "[60] \"Easington is a village in the unitary authority of Redcar and Cleveland and the ceremonial county of North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, the village is situated on the A174 road 1 mile (1.6 km) east from Loftus, and inside the North York Moors National Park. Easington's church, dedicated to All Saints', is Grade II listed. The church was built in 1888–89 by C. Hodgson Fowler in Decorated style, largely with bequests from the Palmer family of Grinkle Park, and incorporated fragments and remains of the previous church. The side chapel and several of the furnishings are by the firm of 'Mousey' Thompson of Kilburn. The village public house, the Tiger Inn, was previously a building of the same name at the opposite end of the village. The village had a railway station on the Whitby, Redcar and Middlesbrough Union Railway. The station was opened in 1883 as Easington, the name changing in 1904 to Grinkle after the local house and seat of the Baronets Palmer, Grinkle Park. The renaming was to avoid confusion with the station at the larger Easington, County Durham, also on the North Eastern Railway's network. The station closed on the eve of the Second World War and never re-opened. <em>Source: Wikipedia</em>\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
